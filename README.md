### Description
This is a web platform that facilitates the search for free time spaces that students have in common. 
This thinking that it is often difficult for us to find gaps in common for academic or recreational 
activities. The idea is that the platform generates a report with the spaces in which the students 
involved are available.

The objective of the project was to perform the following functionalities in a correct and functional way:
- User Registration.
- User Login.

- Generation of available spaces schedule.
- Display of the schedule of available spaces generated for the selected users.
